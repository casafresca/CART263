# Data visualizations project

## Project goal
the goal of this project is use data from a CSV file or API and visualize it in a creative way.

## my goal or vision 

I wanted to do my project on something that I was very passionate about and lately I have been really into the card game Yugioh. So I looked up a Yugioh  API on the internet and found a really nice on ygoprodeck.com, this an open source API that has all the information on every yugioh card in the game. So I decided to make an art gallery of the most popular yugioh card in the game. However, when developing my program I had to display some lesser known cards to show of all the bells and whistles that my program has to offer. So the Yugioh cards I chose to display was : Dark Magician, Dark Magician Girl, Blue Eyes, Elemental HERO Flame Wing Man, Stardust Dragon, Number 39 Utopia, Odd Eyes, Accesscode Talker, Pot of Greed and Mirror Force because those are some of the most popular cards in the game. However I had to add more Pendulum type monster to show all the different types and I had to add Decode Talker to show of some of the features of a specile type of card called Link monsters. 

Also even though I am displaying a specif amount of cards I want my program to be generic and work with all cards in the API/card game so When designing my cards I had to take all the different designs in designing the correct cards.

## Problems and challenges 

My biggest issues is that Im not really visualizing data. my solution was to change the background of cards that are lesser know that are only being displayed because of other reasons like showing off a feature. So the Yugioh cards that not really know to the public has this green spiral image in the background, Yugioh cards that are more know but as famous as the main cards (that I have nicknamed lesser Known cards) with a blue background and the main famous card have a purple/black background. If I had more time I would have made something more artistic to show which card is a popular car and which cards are lesser known.
