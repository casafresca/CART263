# Having fun with particles assignment 1 

## My topic

My topic was Party all night long.

## My ideas and thought process

from the begging of the assignment I knew i wanted something to do with flashing lights, colors and music but it was hard to think of an idea that consisted with only particle effects especially when I had used the combination of particle effects and music in prior assignments in computation arts 1. However, I then thought about telling the story about a  party that lasts all night long. so I came up with an idea to have a disco ball spin in the center of the screen while there is a space theme surrounding it so it feels like the disco ball is suspended in the night sky. I decided to have the particles effects act like stars around the disco ball so that the night sky theme can pronounced more. And I decided to have a music visualizer to capture the party aesthetic.

## Coding challenges 

I wanted to use many particle effects to have a big visual spectacle so that i could capture the theme of my project being about a party however particle effects take up a lot of memory on my computer and I was not able to implement as much as I wanted because my computer just could not handle it. The biggest thing was there was a firework effect that i was working on, that was supposed to occur when the music was supposed to drop. However, the whole program used to run at a snail pase because my computer could not handle it so that code had to be scrapped. I also wanted to make the sphere out of particle so I can make it light up and have different colors but drawing a 3D shape with particles also took up to much memory so I had use the P5.js shapes and use the sphere method to crate the disco ball and apply a texture to the disco ball to make it look like it was mad with particles. the background is a gif on loop that i make shake using my code. I had to opt out for a image because I wanted my project to have lots going on with it because of the whole party theme. At a party there is lots of people, lights, loud music, its a bit chaotic and I wanted to capture that in my project but I could not have to much going on because my computer could not handle it. So I found a gif that fit the theme and style that fit my vision and made sure that all the other parts of my project matched and fit the theme so that I obtain the result that I wanted. 

## Music 

I choose was Sky Full of Stars by Coldplay because it fit perfectly with the theme that i was going for. The lyrics talk about the night sky and stars witch matches the all night aspect of the project and the main meaning of the lyrics of the song is a love story, witch its possible for someone to find love at a party so I also believe that aspect fit the theme of being a party. Also the song is a dance song so that fits the theme of party real nicely. The song originally is 5 min long and I could have my project be 5min long as well so I ended up cutting and mixing the song itself that so it fit the appropriate time frame. However, the version of Sky Full of Stars was a remix from Hardwell because it has more of a party vibe to it  but there was bits and parts of the original that i thought fit my project better so I actually mixed some of those original parts back into the remix of the song.
